# Git Cheat Sheet for Beginners

![Preview of Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/darkmodeisbetter/Git-Cheat-Sheet/blob/master/images/GitCheatSheet.png)


## Intro
This is my first 'project' I have written for Git Hub. I wrote this as a reference for those new to Git and Git BASH. 

I have listed common and basic commands for Git, as well as a simplified description to the commands. 


## Download
Select Download button on this page and copy the link.

* Type 'git clone (copied link)' into git BASH.

* Once repository has downloaded, navigate to the downloaded folder and open index.html to access the Cheat Sheet inside the GitCheatSheet folder.


## Contributions
If you think there are other commonly used commands that need to be added:

 * Fork the repository 
 * Include extra commands in the html file
 * Submit a pull request.
